# Form Validation with ReactJS & Formik

## Introduction

The aim of this project is to develop a form validator for PEC 1 of the subject **Front-end development with JavaScript frameworks** of the UOC Master's Degree in Application Development for Mobile Devices. To do this we use the [React JS](https://https://es.reactjs.org) framework and [Formik](https://formik.org) for the form validation.
